# WA Cilukba (Peek-a-boo) 🙈🛡️

WA Cilukba is a privacy-focused browser extension for WhatsApp Web. It automatically blurs sensitive content (like contact names, photos, and messages) and only reveals them when you hover your mouse over them. Perfect for using WhatsApp in public spaces or protecting your screen from shoulder surfers.

"Cilukba" is the Indonesian word for "Peek-a-boo".

## ✨ Key Features

- **🛡️ Comprehensive Blurring**: Hide contact names, profile photos, message previews, group participant names, and media content.
- **👁️ Hover to Reveal**: Effortlessly unblur specific parts of your screen just by moving your mouse over them.
- **🎨 smooth Animations**: Beautiful 0.3s transitions when revealing and hiding content for a premium feel.
- **⚡ Master Switch**: Instantly toggle all privacy features on or off with a shortcut (`Alt + X`).
